# Psychic-Game

Hello, and welcome to the repository for my Psychic Game. The actual game can be played [here](https://bking1989.github.io/Psychic-Game/).

This was the basic, fundamental version of a project we were assigned in our coding bootcamp. This version of assignment required us to use JavaScript features like arrays, `indexOf`, andd `document.onkeyup` to create a game where a random entry from an array is selected, and the user tries to guess what it is using their keyboard. To keep things simple, the player is guessing random letters rather than random, individual words.

I chose not to stylize this version of the assignment because I wanted to focus on getting the functionality of it working, first, before moving on to a harder version of the assignment. The repository for such can be found [here](https://github.com/bking1989/Word-Guess-Game), and the final version can be played [here](https://bking1989.github.io/Word-Guess-Game/).
